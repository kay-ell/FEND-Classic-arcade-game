# Classic Arcade Game

This is the 3rd project for the Grow with Google Front End Web Development NanoDegree program. This is a clone of the classic Frogger game where the player must avoid obstacles to get across to the other side.


This project was completed with the help of Matthew Cranford's Arcade Game Walkthrough (https://matthewcranford.com/arcade-game-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code-breakdown/).

## How to play

To play, open [index.html (https://github.com/kay-ell/FEND-Classic-arcade-game/blob/master/index.html)] on your favorite web browser.use the arrow keys (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`) to move the player. You must avoid the bugs that are crossing the road at various speeds. To win, you must successfully cross to the other side where the water is.

Good luck and have fun!
